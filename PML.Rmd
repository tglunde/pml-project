Background <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>.

Data being used: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv>

```{r}
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", method = "curl", destfile="training.csv")
training <- read.csv("training.csv")
hist(training$classe)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
